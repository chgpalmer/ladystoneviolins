Special Instructions
---------------

Featured Images

To get the most from Fontfolio's grid-based design on the blog index and archives pages, you can assign Featured Images to your posts. If no Featured Image is present, the theme will pull the post's first attached image instead. If no images are attached to the post, the theme will pull the first image from the content of your post.

The first post on your home page will always display larger than the surrounding posts, at 562 x 461 pixels, cropped. The rest of the posts display at 281 x 211 pixels, cropped. (The theme will size the images for you automatically, so you don't need to crop them yourself, unless you want a very specific crop.)

Social Links

When using Jetpack (http://jetpack.me), you can add links to your Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Tumblr accounts to your site’s header. First, connect these services to Publicize, by going to Settings → Sharing. Once connected, navigate to the Customizer, where you’ll find a new Connect panel. Select the account(s) you want to link to, and their respective icons will appear in the header.

Post Formats

Fontfolio supports Aside, Image, Video, Link, and Quote post formats. Formatted posts appear on blog and archive pages with a post-format-specific symbol on hover.
